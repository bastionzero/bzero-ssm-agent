# BastionZero SSM Agent

BastionZero is a simple to use, SaaS, zero-trust access tool for dynamic cloud environments. BastionZero is the most secure way to lock down remote access to servers, containers, clusters, and VMâ€™s in any cloud, public or private. Registering your targets with BastionZero provides both a webapp and command-line interface to communicate with the BastionZero SSM Agent on targets.

The BastionZero SSM Agent is an agent built from the [Amazon EC2 Simple Systems Manager (SSM) Agent](https://github.com/aws/amazon-ssm-agent) which allows you to quickly and easily executre remote commands or scripts against one or more instances.  However, unlike the existing AWS SSM Agent, the BastionZero SSM Agent provides an additional level of security which ensures that only authorized individuals are accessing and executing commands on targets to the point where BastionZero itself cannot run arbitrary code on a target.

### Building inside docker container (Recommended)
* Install docker: [Install CentOS](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/centos/)

* Build image
```
docker build -t ssm-agent-build-image .
```
* Build the agent
```
docker run -it --rm --name ssm-agent-build-container -v `pwd`:/amazon-ssm-agent ssm-agent-build-image make build-release
```

### Building on Linux

* Install go [Getting started](https://golang.org/doc/install)

* Install rpm-build and rpmdevtools

* [Cross Compile SSM Agent](https://www.ardanlabs.com/blog/2013/10/cross-compile-your-go-programs.html)

* Run `make build` to build the SSM Agent for Linux, Debian, Windows environment.

* Run `make build-release` to build the agent and also packages it into a RPM, DEB and ZIP package.

The following folders are generated when the build completes:
```
bin/debian_386
bin/debian_amd64
bin/linux_386
bin/linux_amd64
bin/linux_arm
bin/linux_arm64
bin/windows_386
bin/windows_amd64
```

### Code Layout

* Source code
    * Core functionality such as worker management is under core/
    * Agent worker code is under agent/
    * Other functionality such as IPC is under common/
* Vendor package source code is under vendor/src
* rpm and dpkg artifacts are under packaging
* build scripts are under Tools/src

### GOPATH

To use vendor dependencies, the suggested GOPATH format is `:<packagesource>/vendor:<packagesource>`
